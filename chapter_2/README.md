# Biophysical characterisation of ORF6 from SARS-CoV-2 

Scripts used to produce figures in Alice Jane Pettitt's thesis. Submitted September 2024 to University College London. 

## This repository contains scripts to produce the simulated Figures from Chapter 2:
1. Script to produce the theoretical behaviour of R1 and R2 as a function of the rotational correlation time figure (thesis_tauc.ipynb)
2. Script to produce the figure showing chemical exchange between two states with populations of 90% and 10% (thesis_chemical_exchange.ipynb)
