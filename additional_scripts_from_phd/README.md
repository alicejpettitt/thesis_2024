# Additional scripts from my PhD (2021-2024) 

Additional input files and scripts from my PhD that didn't make it into my thesis titled 'Biophysical characterisation of ORF6 from SARS-CoV-2' 

I used PLUMED version 2.7.1 and GROMACS 2021.2. 

## This repository contains:
1. `Metainference_orf6_ctr` includes collective variables, plumed input files, and pdb files for the a03ws, a99sb-disp, and c36m force field metadynamic metainference simulations of orf6-ctr peptide. 
2. `D61L_orf6_ctr` includes collective variables, plumed input files, and pdb files for the a03ws metadynamic simulations of orf6-ctr peptide.
3. `Full_length_orf6` includes collective variables, plumed input files, and pdb files for the a99sb and C36m metadynamic simulations of full-length ORF6.
